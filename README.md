## In a nutshell

```
git clone https://github.com/egasimus/glagol-example
cd glagol-example
npm install
./example
```

Now fire up your text editor and edit any file (besides `example` or `start.js`);
try adding new files in `choices/`, too. See how the program reflects your
changes immediately? That's what Glagol is all about.

This leaves a lot of room in the nutshell. Just enough to fit an overview and
perhaps a quick tour of Glagol's inner workings, a.k.a. [The Guide](https://github.com/egasimus/glagol/blob/master/doc/guide.md).
