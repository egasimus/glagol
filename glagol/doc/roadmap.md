# Roadmap

* Regard `Directory` as just another file type?
  * Implement directory extensions
* Implement more options
  * Implement API for introducing custom globals and source transformers
* Finish test suite
  * Replace Jasmine's built-in test runner with a dogfooded one?
* Keep documentation up to date

## Known embarrasing issues

* Options are not passed to newly created nodes
