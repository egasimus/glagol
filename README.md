# Glagol 2.0.0-WIP

Glagol is a JavaScript metaframework, designed from the ground up for enabling
you to build programs that can be edited during runtime, using libraries and
preprocessors of your choosing.

Glagol reloads and processes source files on demand, so you don't need to
set up a complicated build pipeline for compiling your stuff in advance, or
restart your project to see your changes.

## In a nutshell

```
git clone https://github.com/egasimus/glagol-example
cd glagol-example
npm install
./example
```

Now fire up your text editor and edit any file (besides `example` or `start.js`);
try adding new files in `choices/`, too. See how the program reflects your
changes immediately? That's what Glagol is all about.

This leaves a lot of room in the nutshell. Just enough to fit an overview and
perhaps a quick tour of Glagol's inner workings, a.k.a. [The Guide](https://github.com/egasimus/glagol/blob/master/doc/guide.md).
